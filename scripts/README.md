# Scripts

This folder contains various shell scripts for the Deep Research MCP project:

- **local_test.sh**  
  Creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, then runs local tests and coverage checks for the entire codebase.

- **deploy.sh**  
  Builds and pushes a Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR) (or any preferred registry) and then invokes a deploy command for your environment.

Additional scripts can be added here as needed. Update this file as you add or remove scripts.
